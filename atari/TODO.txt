TODO for ISS Tracker for #FujiNet

2024-04-09

 * The switch to fujinet-lib needed some Makefile changes that were pulled
   from other projects, but they can probably be cleaned up a lot

 * Better error handling! (See FIXMEs)

 * Support 400/800 again (build two XEXes)

 * Allow adjusting colors.
   * Save colors to FujiNet (app key); reload on start-up.

 * Disk target should include a DOS (e.g., uDOS ("micro DOS")).

Other ideas:

 * Show night/day
