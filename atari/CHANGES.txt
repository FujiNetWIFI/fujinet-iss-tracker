2024-05-14 "DDT 411"
(All changes by Mark Fisher <https://github.com/markjfisher>)
 * Using fujinet-lib 4.1.1 with improved debugged code :D

2024-05-12 "THE BIG 4"
(All changes by Mark Fisher <https://github.com/markjfisher>)
 * Using fujinet-lib 4.1.0 with latest appkey functions for getting/setting appkey data.
   Not yet integrated into the app though yet.

2024-04-09 "MAKEMAKE"
(All changes by Mark Fisher <https://github.com/markjfisher>)

 * Rewrite Makefiles and build/src structure to align with "new" standard build system for fujinet apps.
   - This is something we're hacking on, someone has to be first, so I folded this is while doing the
     fujinet-lib changes, emulator support, and VERSION string changes.

 * Use fujinet-lib for appkey code and remove all direct SIO calls

 * Use VERSION_STRING in makefiles/common.mk and pass it as a 'define' variable to the src code

 * The new build structure supports platform target src code, and nested sub-directory src folders
   - To illustrate the flexibility, code has been arranged into "atari", and "common" code befitting
     whether it is platform specific or not. Note: colours are considered independent, but next implementation
     may change that assumption, so files can be moved around.

 * Add Altirra emulator support as well as atari800, defaults to Altirra for its Fujinet support
   + To run the emulator:
     - Define "ALTIRRA_HOME" or "ATARI800_HOME" to the paths of the executables
     - For altirra: "make test"
     - For atari800: "make test ATARI_EMULATOR=ATARI800"   

2024-04-07 "GOLD RUSH"
 * New features:
   * Supports some Unicode characters in astronaut names;
     uses those from International ATASCII font when possible
     (requires XL/XE)

 * Build & implementation changes:
   * Now fetches and uses the fujinet network library.

     (h/t Frank Rachel)

 * Other improvements:
   * Slightly faster text blitting

2022-05-29 "ARGONAUTS"
 * Implementation changes:
   * Now uses #FujiNet firmware's built-in JSON fetching & parsing
     functionality.
     (https://github.com/FujiNetWIFI/fujinet-platformio/wiki/JSON-Query-Format)
     (Note: Requires fujinet-platformio firmware as of commit
     "5785d76860245863254f91736d42f6c0f61182c6", 2022-05-29)

2021-05-21 "BORDERS"
 * Visual improvements:
   * Black (rather than ocean blue) screen borders
   * Different color for text window at the bottom (better contrast)
   * Astronaut names will word-wrap if necessary

2021-05-19 "VIVID"
 * New features:
   * Can pull data from "Where the ISS?" to track upcoming
     positions on the map. (Press [T])
   * Auto-refresh ISS's position (now press [R] to refresh manually)
   * Previous ISS positions leave a trail (of sprites)
   * Audible feedback when interacting with the program
 * Visual improvements:
   * Improved default map colors; removed grid from continents
   * Faster and nicer looking text blitting over the map
   * Nicer color-cycling of ISS sprite
   * Label latitude (N/North) & longitude (E/East)
 * Build changes:
   * New STARTADDRESS (so folks who forget to disable BASIC can
     run it)

2021-05-18 "OVERCAST"
 * Initial release
   + Displays map, fetches ISS position and can show who's in space
     (both via data from "Open-Notify")
